Jaapz's Dotfiles
================

I used to manually manage my dotfiles in a git repo with several branches. This
became a big ugly mess of merges everywhere, so I decided to switch to a
dotfile manager. I now use homeshick to manage the dotfiles in this repo, and I
hope this won't end up as a huge mess.
